It's a new year and I made (better said: started with making) a new personal website.
You can see all the glory over there at [svenk.org](https://svenk.org).
This is a blog post about failures, a small tale of personal experiences and
a number of links and hints to build strong and enduring websites in the future.

## The cycle of misery

My personal websites tend to have a life-cycle of

1. Starting as something plain texty
2. Getting style and functionality
3. Getting dynamic and over-engineered, with databases, cross-loaded (remote) content,
   some fancy caching system, tightly connected to the web server, directory structure,
   URLs, and all that
4. Something breaks (the server, some dependency, moving to another job, or
   just getting abandoned)
5. Defunct mess is leftover. Start again from 1!

For me, the average life (cycle) span of this is about 5-10 years, so this is probably really
something happening on the long scale! That's one of the few adavantages of getting
old: Being able to observe self-made problems.

## Dependency hell

Let's face it: A website is some form of application (it always has been since
the early days of JavaScript and Java applets), and there is one big factor of
badly aging sofware: *Dependencies*. The more you have, the more you will suffer
from a rotting ecosystem.

I have a love-hate relationships with complex systems, and I code websites since more
then 20 years. My software stack started with [DHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_HTML),
moved over to CGI and Perl, PHP,
classical [LAMP stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)), Python,
Flask, Django, larger PHP frameworks, modern day
all-stack-Javascript. As a late adopter, I finally found happiness in the  [JAM
Stack](https://jamstack.org/).

## A tale about longlivety

When it comes to software development, longlivety is rarely on the top list of features
wanted by customers. Maintainability may be an issue, and of course stability, for the
expected period of use. But hardly anybody in modern day software cares about long-time,
this does not pay. And this is (normally) not even done by purpose, as in
[planned obsolecence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence). Most developers
just do not care about future-proof codes.

24 years ago, the inventor of the web Tim Berners Lee wrote the essay 
[Cool URIs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html). And yet, for decades,
and still today, designing a proper URL system (something which would be called routing
at the conceptual successors of Ruby-on-Rails) that lasts is seldomly done. If it works,
it's just good enough.

On a personal level, over the scales of years, many basic conditions may still no more hold
true. People marry, change their surname, and whoops, the domain name is no more valid.
Preserving old websites can become costly, not only by holding all previous domain names
in one's life, but also by somehow keeping the infrastructure running. There was a time
when shared hosting got out of trend, and people set up their own rented 
virtual machines (VPS). Later, cloud services attracted applications. If it is not the
story of [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities), then it is the story
of money and time to keep old infrastructure running. Economically, it might be trivial to
keep old systems running thanks to virtualization and ongoing ever increasing
availability of computing ressources (for instance, an exponentially dropping price of
RAM and hard disc storage).
