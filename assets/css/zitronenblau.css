This is some Jekyll/Liquid kung fu to basically perform a "include *.css".
I know I could have used integrated SASS/SCSS with sourcemaps, but it did
not work (not even with simple @include "foo.css").

{% for file in site.static_files %}
{% if file.path contains "assets/css" %}
    {% assign filenameparts = file.path | split: "/" %}
    {% assign filename = filenameparts | last %}
    /*** Start of CSS code coming from {{ filename }} ***/
    {% include_relative {{filename}} %}
    /*** End of CSS code coming from {{ filename }} ***/
    
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
